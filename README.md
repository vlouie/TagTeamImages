General Notes:
- the files and subdirectories in this folder should all go into your public\_html
- when adding a new file, always remember to do 'chmod 755 <filename>' on it!
- when adding a new folder, always remember to do 'chmod 711 <foldername>' on it!
- the tmp folder is for the temporary session files (user login system)
- temp.php is just a junk file for testing things
- index.php is the main page
